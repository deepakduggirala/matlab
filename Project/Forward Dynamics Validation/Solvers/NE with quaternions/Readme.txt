m = get_test_2D_model({1 or 2 or 3})
generates model for FDNEQ where links are all on x-axis connected with spherical joints, essentially a 2-D linkage
gravity is along -ve y-axis

FDNEQ - Forward Dynamics with Newtn Euler using Quaternions
FDNEQ(n) returns second derivative of each joint quaternion
